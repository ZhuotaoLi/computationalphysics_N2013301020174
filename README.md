武汉大学计算物理作业
My name is wangqi,from physics school of WHU,who find it a challenge and chance to learn computational physics for comprehending computer.
What's more,our computational physics teacher is someone with real class .Althong,sometimes handsome is erverything,the real thing is really
the most important in class .I look forward to what a big change will happen to me about computer after this semester.Also, I expect to know 
the realationship between computer and phsics more.In this procee,I whish this class can be understood and used peoperly.Maybe,it can make
phsics more easy to learn and we can sovle physical problem more easily,which is also the reason why I choose this class.Life is like a box
of chocolate,you never know what you're goning to get,so is this class.What is worth mentioning is I like to eat chocolate.
How about you?
